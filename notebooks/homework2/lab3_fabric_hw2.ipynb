This book focuses on the eldest son of the prominent New York banking family. Halwyn enjoys his prestigious position in the family bank and his comfortable position still living in the family home. But, at 27 years old, he is about to be pushed out of his comfort zone. His mother has decided that it is high time he took a bride and Halwyn finds himself in the awkward position of being mother's project at this year's Cotillion Ball. Grace is attending her third ball and has become of the \"poor unfortunates\" sitting on the sidelines. Although she is a beautiful young woman who stands to inherit a sizable fortune, her greedy step-father has made it his mission to see that Grace does not attract any suitors. By keeping her in unfashionable clothing and restricting her attendance at social functions, it is beginning to look like Simon will accomplish his goal. At least, that is, until Halwyn puts on his new and much-needed spectacles and finds himself blinded by Grace.|\n|4     |13299748|Why the heck did I find this book funny? Does that make me a sicko?

It provides a superficial telling of Obi Wan Kenobi, famed Jedi. Told through a sub-story of Luke Skywalker finding his Journal, it recounts Obi Wan's involvement in Episodes 1 through 6 of the saga. There are nods to other stories and characters in the Expanded Universe (or Legends series, as it is now known).  Targeted for junior readers or people new to the Star Wars franchise, I found it too basic and lacking detail about one of the more famous and charismatic Jedi (being a Fanboy, myself!).

This is just one of the stories in the Sweet Christmas Kisses 3 box set.  This was a very cute story. Annie is heading to Uganda for the holidays to stay with her parents who are doing charity work there. On the way she bumps into Raj in a discheveled tux and immediately makes some snap judgements about his character. She was in for a surprise when she found out they were going to the same place.  Very sweet story, sad and hopeful at the same time. The descriptions of the hospital and conditions for patients really came through the pages well.

This book focuses on the eldest son of the prominent New York banking family. Halwyn enjoys his prestigious position in the family bank and his comfortable position still living in the family home. But, at 27 years old, he is about to be pushed out of his comfort zone. His mother has decided that it is high time he took a bride and Halwyn finds himself in the awkward position of being mother's project at this year's Cotillion Ball. Grace is attending her third ball and has become of the \"poor unfortunates\" sitting on the sidelines. Although she is a beautiful young woman who stands to inherit a sizable fortune, her greedy step-father has made it his mission to see that Grace does not attract any suitors. By keeping her in unfashionable clothing and restricting her attendance at social functions, it is beginning to look like Simon will accomplish his goal. At least, that is, until Halwyn puts on his new and much-needed spectacles and finds himself blinded by Grace.|\n|87           |Why the heck did I find this book funny? Does that make me a sicko?

It provides a superficial telling of Obi Wan Kenobi, famed Jedi. Told through a sub-story of Luke Skywalker finding his Journal, it recounts Obi Wan's involvement in Episodes 1 through 6 of the saga. There are nods to other stories and characters in the Expanded Universe (or Legends series, as it is now known).  Targeted for junior readers or people new to the Star Wars franchise, I found it too basic and lacking detail about one of the more famous and charismatic Jedi (being a Fanboy, myself!). I'd rather read this as a primer piece to the detailed Kenobi by John Jackson Miller.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|210          |This was a quick read, but enjoyable.

This is just one of the stories in the Sweet Christmas Kisses 3 box set.  This was a very cute story. Annie is heading to Uganda for the holidays to stay with her parents who are doing charity work there. On the way she bumps into Raj in a discheveled tux and immediately makes some snap judgements about his character. She was in for a surprise when she found out they were going to the same place.  Very sweet story, sad and hopeful at the same time. The descriptions of the hospital and conditions for patients really came through the pages well. I absolutely loved all of the characters in this story, from Annie and Raj to her parents and friends.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|352          |This is the most depressing book I think I have ever read.

such a weirdo because i didn't love this book. i did think it was a lot of fun and i liked how it did push the envelope, but it felt almost too heavy handed. i felt like the story was just too broken up with commercials and footnotes, at the beginning i loved this, but towards the end i was just dying to know what was going to happen next! there was a beginning of a bookmance... but sadly i fell out of love a bit by the end.  my favorite part about \"beauty queens\" was the characters- they were fantastic! they were all endearing in their own ways, even if i did want to slap them a couple of times. i liked how they all had their insecurities, which made them entertaining and relatable. some of the characters may have been a bit far fetched, hell most of the book is pretty unbelievable, but libba bray is a master at making the ridiculous work in her books. i think her characters are what bring the readers back to reality when they sometimes feel like they are in a parallel dimension.  the over abundance of romance kind of bothered me a bit in this book. it just seemed to come a little too easily for everyone, but by the end it came back to reality a bit. i don't know why this bothered me so much, this book obviously isn't super realistic, but i worry when books create these impossibly perfect romances- love is wonderful, but it is not perfect... nothing is!  i really did like how this book was able to deal with some pretty controversial issues in a way that showed how important they are, but without being depressing or too serious. i liked how the girls decided they wanted to create basically a girl power convention where there were lectures on subjects from makeovers to self-respect. i also liked how the book discussed sexuality in every way i could possibly think.  \"beauty queens\" is a great book; it deals with a lot of important issues and i actually really appreciated this. i just wish there weren't as many fake commercials. this book probably isn't for all readers; i can see some people being offended by this book. it is definitely for mature readers. i feel like readers who enjoyed \"airhead\" series by meg cabot will probably enjoy this

take a moment to process what was going on.  besides the fact that the background of this world is totally crazypants, i felt like this had a lot more depth than i realized. i loved that the pageant girls were more than anyone (even themselves) thought, i loved that taylor is batshit crazy and that adina is intentionally hard to like, i love that gender and sexual orientation play a large part of the book, and i love that you get to know all the main characters instead of just one.  overall, i would suggest this book to everyone that wants a ridiculous read with a serious message.

and even then, only seeing a tiny sliver of a very large pie? the bravery and trust it took for women to get on a train with only a promise that they'd be doing good for the war effort and \"everything will be taken care of\" astounds me the most.  anyone with an interest in the manhattan project and/or wwii (particularly women's experiences) will enjoy this book.
